      	This month we are celebrating the <strong>French Cuisine</strong>. Its history dates back to the early Middle Ages with the elaboration of culinary treaties and cursory recipes.Sugar was put in water, wine and even on fish and meat! French food truly became a model for other cuisines in the 17th century. Make a date to come and celebrate with us. Specials will be made by the great <strong>Chef Thomas Keller</strong>, who has notoriously been awarded three star Michelin ratings.</span>

      	‚ÄúWe couldn‚Äôt be more happy with our decision to have Ochre cater our wedding. Craig and Carley run a well-oiled catering machine and even with the added pressure of COVID-19 restrictions plus the usual chaos of a wedding ‚Äì we did not have to worry about a single thing with them. Not only was the service seamless (even offsite in a farm shed) but the food was absolutely delicious. Our guests were delighted, everyone was so happy with their meals and it was everything we had hoped for. We highly recommend speaking to Ochre about catering for any event.‚Äù<br><strong>Kristy & Brendan 31st August 2020</strong>

      	‚ÄúFirstly I just wanted to say thank you so much for all your work that went into both evenings for our Festival of Food and our Gala night at Tanks, we have had such great feedback especially on the food component of these events. I have loved dealing with you guys although I moved stages around and requested additional cocktails and Vodka you still made it all happen in the most amazing way!‚Äù<br><strong>Peta ‚Äì Events Manager IOOF</strong>

      	This is possibly the best restaurant I have ever been to! The thing that really made this meal so enjoyable for us along with the amazing food and wine, was the service. It's not forced or pushy or fake, its very professional with a personal touch, the waiter and waitresses were extremely helpful and knowledgable about all the dishes, and at the end they shook our hand thanking us for our custom. All the chefs in the open plan kitchen took a few seconds out of their busy time to thank us and wish us a good night. Now where else do you get that kind of service?Can't wait to visit again.Book your table now<br><strong>Maggie Chuck, Guest</strong>
